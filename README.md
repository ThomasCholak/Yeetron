Webpage home is here. This utilizes the latest three.js modeling code to extract various blender models I created. These models are interactive and will move interactively according to mouse movement. Mobile and desktop environments work, with different interfaces for both (coded with CSS and vanilla JS). A loading screen may appear briefly as 3D models generate.

The '<b>About Me</b>' is very much a work in progress. I plan to maybe redirect mobile browsers since this takes too long to load on mobile and some of the functionaily is lost if not using a desktop.

However, this uses various textures to create realistic water simulation, light reflection, and a mirror simulation. Scrolling the mouse wheel allows for some fun animations ðŸ˜Š

This uses a standard grid layout. Images will increase in size as you hover over them. I plan to optimize so not all images load simulateneouly for faster load times and I want to make images clickable for fullscreen as well.

This is a goofy game I created in about an hour. <i>See if you can make the high score!</i>

CSS code allows for a color changing background and JS is used for gameplay. I plan to make game less break-able in the future and also add some more challenges. Maybe I'll add games/change models in the future as well.
